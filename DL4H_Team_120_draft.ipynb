    "## 1.1 Background of the problem\n",
    "Graph-structured data are ubiquitous in various applications of healthcare domain, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction and drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) (Velickovic et al., 2018), as one of the most popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has been widely adopted in these applications due to its ability to effectively model relationships between nodes in a graph. In this project, we are trying to explore the role of GAT in healthcare domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. what type of problem: disease/readmission/mortality prediction,  feature engineeing, data processing, etc \\\n",
    "**Ans:** Drug-drug Interaction (DDI), Protein-protein Interaction (PPI), and Link Prediciton in PubMed Citation Network. Starting from these three tasks, we explore the potential of GAT in healthcare domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. what is the importance/meaning of solving the problem \\\n",
    "**Ans:** These three tasks are representative in healthcare domains: DDI prediciton aims to identify potentially adverse interactions between drugs, helping to enhance patient safety and treatment effectiveness. PPI prediction focuses on understanding how proteins interact within the human body, which is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies and understanding biological processes. Finally, link prediction in PubMed Citation Network can uncover hidden relationships between various medical studies, enhancing the synthesis of medical knowledge and fostering new research insights. By addressing these problems using the Graph Attention Networks (GAT), we leverage advanced machine learning techniques to provide more accurate predictions and deeper insights\n",
    "\n",
    "3. what is the difficulty of the problem \\\n",
    "**Ans:** The difficulty of these problems lies in the following areas: complexity of interactions, sparsity of known interactions, and the need for accurate and generalizable predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. the state of the art methods and effectiveness \\\n",
    "**Ans:** Since our project focuses on the role of GAT in healthcare domain applications, this question is not applicable."

    "## 1.2 Paper explanation\n",
    "1. what did the paper propose \\\n",
    "**Ans**: The paper introduced Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which utilize masked self-attentional layers to operate on graph-structured data. GATs allow each node to attend over its neighborhoods' features dynamically, which improves flexibility and performance over previous methods that relied on graph convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. what is the innovations of the method \\\n",
    "**Ans**: The innovations include the use of attention mechanisms that allow for different weights to be assigned to different nodes in a neighborhood, enhancing model capacity and interpretability. The GATs perform efficiently without needing costly matrix operations and are applicable to both inductive and transductive learning tasks. They also employ multi-head attention to stabilize the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. how well the proposed method work (in its own metrics) \\\n",
    "**Ans**: GATs achieved or matched state-of-the-art results (till the date it was published) on several transductive and inductive graph benchmarks, including Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed citation networks, and a protein-protein interaction dataset. Notably, the results demonstrated the effectiveness of attention-based models on graph-structured data, particularly showing a significant improvement in the inductive learning task on the protein-protein interaction dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. what is the contribution to the reasearch regime (referring the Background above, how important the paper is to the problem). \\\n",
    "**Ans**: The paper contributes significantly to the domain of graph neural networks by providing a more flexible and powerful alternative to previous models like GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks). By applying GATs in the healthcare domains, the performance of most of tasks with graph structures improved a lot. Specifically, in drug-drug interaction prediction task, each drug is modeled as a molecule graph whose features can be extracted by GAT. For the PPI and link prediciton, both tasks contains networks, also a graph structure that can be fed into GATs.\n",
